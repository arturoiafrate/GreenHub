This game was developed by me (Arturo Iafrate), Pasquale Celardo, Vincenzo Selvaggio, Giuseppe Fatigati, Raffaele Tramontano and Emanuele Violante during the W2 course at the iOS Foundation Program organized by the University of Naples "Parthenope" in partnership with Apple.

This watchOS app needs the iPhone companion app.
